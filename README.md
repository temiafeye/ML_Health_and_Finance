Malaria is one of Sub-Saharan Africa's greatest plagues,
Sub-Saharan Africa continues to carry a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. 
In 2015, the region was home to 90% of malaria cases and 92% of malaria deaths.

AI in recent times is offering interest ideas and solutions
in detection and of course in the eventual eradication of Malaria.

The goal of this project is to images trained on deep neural nets to identify parasitized malaria cells 
from uninfected one using data obtained from about 27,986 images.

Here the keras library is used and ConvNet is employed in training the images.
